# api-nexus

This is based on a [Scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-cryptocurrency-comparison-site-with-vuejs), which covers building a website to compare cryptocurrencies. I'm working through the tutorial but focusing on building everything in Vuetify instead of Bootstrap, then I am going to go on to work on making some other API calls to other services and display the data in a pretty format.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
